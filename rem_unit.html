<!-- 'rem' units are always a better choice to use rather tham 'em' units as 'rem' units take the size of root element (the html tag in this case) as a reference to set font-sizes of the tags. I nthe below case as we have mentioned the size of the html tag as 20px the sizes of the box-1 element as well as the nested elements will be relative to the root html tag as we have used 'rem' units. So the size of the box-1 div would be 40px(20*2) and the size of the p tag would be 36px(20*1.6) and the line-height would be 37px(20*1.7). Here even though the p tag is nested inside the box-1 div, it would set it's size according to the root html tag only and not it's parent box-1 div unlike when we use the 'em' units. This makes using the 'rem' units a far better choice to maintain consistency and for ease of usage. -->
